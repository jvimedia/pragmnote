pragm is a Open Source multiuser Scratchpad inspired by Microsoft OnenoteÂ®. [Sorry! No online demo right now]

Pull requests are welcome

## What I have already done:

- I built a editor which has a (a the moment) simple file-explorer
- I built up a node.js WebSocket server which synchronizes documents to the editor in realtime
- Because of each key input synchronizes immediately the web application produces a huge amount of traffic.
- To reduce this I created a differential algorithm
- Now I am happy to say that my synchronization needs less traffic than Google Docs

## Ideas for future:

- Expand the editor with drawing functions, math formulas, ... and whatever you can imagine and code
- Build a bigger functionality to explore files and edit user settings
- Show which user edits which element
- Sometime: Add more editors (presentation, spreadsheet, etc.)

Actually the "sync engine" runs pretty good and is flexible to add more and more functions to pragm. Also it is possible to use the basis of pragm to create a new completely different web application.

Furthermore I plan to build a js-library for differential realtime synchronization.

## How to start a quick Demo:
 - install node.js
 - in the first line of bin/server/serverBuild.js you can change the server-port
 - run bin/server/serverBuild.js with node in the same directory (the scirpt needs to find data/)
 > Command: .../bin/server/>node serverBuild.js
 - open bin/client/index.html with Google Chrome (Safary should work to, but is not tested)
